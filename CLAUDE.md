# zirc3

This is essentially a next-generation version of The Lounge IRC - a multi-tenant IRC bouncer Elysia server, which is accessed via a SolidJS web app.

Currently we only handle single user with no auth, while implementing the core functionality.

## Philosophy

Using class definitions in the server app is appropriate for many of its components.

## Scripts

`bun check-types`
